# Module 5 Server-side Frontend
## Frontend for Knitting Workbook web application

For this project I used the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React, Node.js). 

I started creating a Hello World application with Express. Then I created a Mongodb account and database. I connected the backend to a React front end and finally hosted the api on Heroku.
In the application you can add a object/project to the database through a form. The projects are then displayed on the web site upon saving in a table. It then is possible to delete a project from the database list.

The inspiration for this web application is to have a place to keep all of your knitting projects at one place. Often knitters make a lot of gifts and items and it would be nice for them to have a place to see and remember all of their creations. In the future I would like to add routing and more elements to the form. For expample to upload a photo, to write a description, have a start and finishing dates with inprogress bar and so much more!

This web app only has some only basic styling as it's purpose is to learn more about the backend. Hopefully it will be upgraded in the future.

I hope you like it!
